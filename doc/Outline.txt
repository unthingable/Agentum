Initial working title: "Simply Complexity" or "Modeling Social Complexity for Hackers" or "Hacking Social Complexity"

The purpose of this book is to introduce the readers to the field of complex system modeling and specifically social complexity -- and get their feet wet building and understanding models of complex systems in a variety of settings, and interpreting what the models say. There will be a lot of code in the book, and a lot of exercises inviting readers to write code. Each chapter will roughly cover an area of research in complex system models, and end with a reading list and a open research problems -- an invitation for readers to make their own mark in the field. 

I would like to get a couple prominent people in the field to contribute writing and/or code to the book -- but probably not invite them as co-authors. Is there a good way to do contributed chapters?

Also -- as I'm developing the outline, I'm realizing that this may not fit into the short-form bookâ€¦ Shall we do a long-form or split this up?

The book will be based on an open-source Python modeling toolkit Socium which I am developing with a few collaborators. Readers will be invited to contribute to development of the toolkit as well.
